### 2. Create a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain an item and its price in float. Write a program to print each item and its price in a proper format

tuple = [('apple',100.5),('banana',50.0),('kiwi',200.5),('orange',80.5)]
for i in tuple:
    print ('item :',i)
print ('The items and its price is:',tuple)
